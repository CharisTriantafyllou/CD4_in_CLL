# CD4_in_CLL
Code used for the bioinformatic analysis involved in my Thesis Project. Analysis of high-throughput data focused on the effect of CLL to CD4+ cells. There is code for scRNA-seq analysis focused on CD4+ cells, as well as code for the Visualization of bulk ATAC-seq and bulk RNA-seq data.
